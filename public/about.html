  <p>Hi! I'm Lijil P P, a 20-year-old B.Tech student currently studying at the College of Engineering Thalassery. 
  I come from the beautiful district of Kannur, Kerala. Passionate about technology and learning, I have a strong academic background and a deep interest in web development.</p>
  <p>Alongside my technical interests, I'm a dedicated cinema enthusiast â€” a true cinephile. I love exploring movies from all genres and languages, and I'm always up for a good film discussion. 
  My hobbies and skills combine creativity with logic, making me someone who enjoys both building things and appreciating the art behind storytelling.</p>
